        <h1>The Quest for the Ultimate Taste: A Culinary Mystery at IIT Bhilai</h1>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>It all started on a lazy evening in the IIT Bhilai cafeteria, where a heated debate was brewing—not about academics or technology, but about food...</p>
            <p><q>Nothing beats a plate of butter naan with rich, creamy paneer butter masala!</q> one declared.</p>
            <p><q>You haven't lived until you've had a perfectly crispy dosa with coconut chutney</q>, argued another.</p>
            <p><q>Forget all that! A cheesy slice of pizza is the true comfort food!</q> a third countered.</p>
            <p>Some swore by the fiery goodness of spicy dishes, while others preferred the delicate balance of sweet and savory flavors. Amidst the chaos, I had a realization—why not settle this once and for all with real data?</p>
            <p>Was North Indian cuisine truly the undisputed king? Did everyone really prefer spicy food? And what about gender-based differences?</p>
